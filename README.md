# droice_labs_test
Test task for one company

Task text:
"Attached is a small extraction from one of our surgery-related datasets with patients who underwent certain surgical interventions (1000 data points). The dataset has both artificial and real noises and corruptions applied to it.

Your task will be:
to clean and vectorize the data: includes getting rid of outliers, encoding missing values, scaling data and other data transformations that you find relevant
do visual exploration of features and their correlations; include a handful of interesting charts that help you formulate some simple modelling hypotheses;
determine one or several target features that you can predict within the dataset (e.g. smoking status, patient age, mortality outcome etc.) and try fitting a model that predicts your targets; document your model selection and hyper parameter tuning routines and briefly explain choices you made. Alternatively, you can choose to apply certain clustering techniques and try to interpret the clusters that youâ€™ve learnt."
